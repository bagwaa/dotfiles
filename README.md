# My personal neovim configuration

### TMUX Plugin install

`<CTRL> A <SHIFT> I`

### Neovim Plugin Install

Inside neovim run `:PackerSync`, `:PackerCompile`, and `:PackerClean`

### Creating a test from a corresponding file

- Goto the file you want to test, for example `User.php` in the models directory
- Type `,e` which will try and switch to the test for that class
- If it can't find one, it will ask if you want to create a feature test or a unit test
- Once the blank file is open, type `ftest` or `utest` to load a test class snippet

### Sidebar

- `,1` to toggle the sidebar with the current file focused
- `,2` to collapse all open directories in the sidebar

### Buffers

- `[b and ]b` to move left and right through buffers

### Git

- `]h and [h` to move up and down through hunks

### Lsp

- Use `:LspInfo` to see what language servers are attached to the current buffer
- use `:Mason` to install and update language servers
- use `:PhpActorClassNew` to create a new class from a template

### Terminal

- `,cc` to toggle a terminal window that floats

### Running Tests

- `,tt` when viewing a test runs the whole test suite
- `,tn` when viewing a test runs the test nearest the cursor
- `,tf` when viewing a test runs all the tests in the file

### Commenting code / Uncommenting Code

- Use `SHIFT-V` to get into visual block mode
- `gc` to comment or uncomment

### Change surrounding stuff

- To change double quotes to double, from "test" to 'test' place the cursor over the double quote and then type the command `cs"'` (change surround from " to ')

### Deleting HTML attributes

- Use `dax` to delete around the xml attribute (ie, class="foo") or
- Use `dix` to delete inside the xml attribute (ie, class="foo")

### Fuzzy Finding

- `<Ctrl>+P` to find files
- `<leader> p` to find files
- `<leader> pp` to find files including vendor directories
- `<leader> ppp` to find files only in the git repository
- `<leader> o` to find recently opened files
- `<leader> bb` to find a file in an open buffer
- `<leader> ff` to find a file containing some text (ripgrep)

When searching using ripgrep we can pass some extra arguments in the search like so :-

- `"foo" app` search for foo in the app directory
- `"foo" -tphp` search for foo in php files only
- `"foo" -tphp app` search for foo in php files only within the app folder
