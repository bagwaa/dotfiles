Implement the following plan:

# Track Zed Editor Configuration in Dotfiles

## Context
The user wants to version-control their Zed editor configuration (`settings.json` and `keymap.json`) alongside their other dotfiles, following the same patterns already established in the repository.

## Sensitivity Check
- **`keymap.json`** - Safe. Contains only key bindings, no sensitive data.
- **`settings.json`** - Safe. Contains editor preferences only. There is a `context7_api_key` field but it is currently **empty** (`""`). If an API key is ever added there, it would be tracked in git — worth being aware of.

## Changes

### 1. Create `zed/` directory and copy config files
- Create `zed/` directory in the dotfiles repo
- Copy `~/.config/zed/settings.json` → `zed/settings.json`
- Copy `~/.config/zed/keymap.json` → `zed/keymap.json`

### 2. Update install script (`install`)
Add symlink entries following the existing `opencode` pattern (mkdir + rm + ln):
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/zed
rm -fr $HOME/.config/zed/settings.json
ln -s $DOTFILES/zed/settings.json $HOME/.config/zed/settings.json
rm -fr $HOME/.config/zed/keymap.json
ln -s $DOTFILES/zed/keymap.json $HOME/.config/zed/keymap.json
```

### 3. Update `CLAUDE.md`
- Add **Zed** to the repository overview list
- Add symlink entries to the installation section
- Add a brief Zed configuration section

### 4. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
Add an entry documenting the addition of Zed config tracking.

## Verification
- Run `./install` and confirm symlinks are created correctly with `ls -la ~/.config/zed/settings.json ~/.config/zed/keymap.json`
- Both should point back to the dotfiles repo

Check that functions.sh doesn't have anything sensitive, and if not, the commit it to the repo and make sure the instractions are added in the README to add source ~/Code/dotfiles/functions.sh to .zshrc

I've started using https://entire.io which has created some hooks for claude in settings.json inside my .claude folder for this repo, should this be commited or not?
